li3_metrics Usage
------------------
In your config/bootstrap/libraries.php file, add:

Libraries::add('li3_metrics');

You may need to do some additional configuration to discount specific URLs from being counted.
You may also wish to setup the admin pages to fit into your application and protect them.
You will likely need the FlashMessages library unless you remove the calls in the controller 
as well as the Paginator library for the helper unless you use your own.
